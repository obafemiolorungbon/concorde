Create a CLI tool to help purge unused tailwind css without actually setting it up in your project, this is meant to help people that want to use tailwind for html projects
without setting up tailwind. Its just a quick, pick and drop tool for purging css

How would it work : (Top of the head idea)

so, probably have a folder with the index.js for the package, with tailwind set up already. Therefore, all you have to pass to tailwind is the files or link to directory
that contain the html/jsx or whichever, for the tailwind project. Then the tool spit out the build css needed for the project. No configurations needed. 

So basically
1. Have a folder for the package, that has tailwind installed as a dependency, as well as the neccesary tools to purge;
2. The tool will receive the path to the folder containing the files to be purged
3. the tool will then create a file css, in the directory that you can then use in your final html which will be as light as possible.
