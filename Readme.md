2. After you must have tweaked your developement html, jsx or any other framework you want, you will want to generate a smaller css build for the production or to launch your project. you will then run [a certain command] which will also provide you with an interactive session to ask you where you want to spit final build. also there is option for minified css which greatly reducess the size of the final css build.
